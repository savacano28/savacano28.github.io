Personal Website for Lawrence Cheng

Synopsis: This is a personal webpage developed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to display information about myself. It also used the Materialize library for certain CSS components. It contains
my background, projects, and experience that I have had in the past.

Note: Currently optimized for full-screen webpage on desktop.
